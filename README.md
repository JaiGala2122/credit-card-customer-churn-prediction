Project Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded 10,000 customer records with 14 features
Analyzed data structure and distributions
Verified data quality (no missing values detected)
Examined basic statistics and data types

2. Data Preprocessing

Removed irrelevant columns (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname)
Encoded categorical variables:

Gender: Label Encoding (Male=1, Female=0)
Geography: One-Hot Encoding (created Germany, Spain dummy variables)


Converted data types (Exited and HasCrCard to int8)
No missing values or duplicates found

3. Feature Engineering
Created new features to enhance model performance:

BalanceToSalary: Ratio of account balance to estimated salary
TenureAgeRatio: Ratio of tenure years to customer age
IsZeroBalance: Binary indicator for zero balance accounts
AgeGroup: Categorical bins (Young: 18-30, Middle: 31-40, Senior: 41-50, Elderly: 50+)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis

Churn Distribution: 20.37% churn rate (7,963 stayed, 2,037 exited)
Numerical Features Analysis:

Created histograms for CreditScore, Age, Tenure, Balance, EstimatedSalary
Generated correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships


Categorical Analysis:

Gender: Female 25.1% churn vs Male 16.5% churn
Geography: Germany 32% churn, France 16%, Spain 17%
Age Distribution: Overlapping histograms showing churned vs stayed customers


Key Finding: Age is a strong predictor with older customers showing higher churn

5. Model Training & Evaluation

Data Split: 80% training (8,000 samples), 20% testing (2,000 samples)
Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features
Models Trained:

Logistic Regression (baseline, random_state=42, max_iter=1000)
Random Forest (random_state=42, n_estimators=100)
Gradient Boosting (random_state=42, n_estimators=100)


Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy scores on test set
ROC-AUC scores
5-fold cross-validation scores
Confusion matrices
Classification reports (precision, recall, f1-score)
ROC curves comparison



6. Feature Importance Analysis

Extracted feature importances from Gradient Boosting model
Identified and visualized top 10 most important features
Generated actionable business insights based on feature importance
Analyzed age group contributions to churn prediction

Interpretation:

High precision (88%) for predicting customers who will stay
Model correctly identifies 97% of customers who stay (recall)
79% precision for churn prediction
49% recall for churned customers indicates room for improvement in catching all churners
